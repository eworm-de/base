ABOUT:
        org.bus1.activator: The system service activator. It sets up
        bus connection for services and executes them on-demand.
        - sets up the service environment:
                - a new mount namespace
                - a separate tmpfs /
                - mounts the kernel filesystems
                - mounts /usr with the system image
                - mounts /var with the /var/bus1/<service> data directory
        - starts org.bus1.devices

        org.bus1.coredump: A crash handler which logs a stack trace of a failing
        process.
        - called by the kernel when a process crashes
        - writes stacktrace to the kernel log buffer
        - optionally writes the core file to /var/coredump/<user id>-<escaped binary name>

        org.bus1.devices: The hotplug device manager and kernel module loading
        service.
        - listens to kernel uevents
        - crawls /sys for coldplug
        - adjusts platform permissions in /dev
        - loads kernel modules for plugged devices

        org.bus1.diskctl: A command line tool to manage signed and encrypted
        disk volumes.
        - adds a metadata header to a filesystem image and creates a
          cryptographic hash tree to provide data integrity validation;
          used for the org.bus1.disk.system image mounted at /usr
        - adds a metadata header for an encrypted volume; used for the
          org.bus1.disk.data volume mounted at /var

        org.bus1.example: This simple example of the org.bus1.administrator
        just starts a tty and a serial console login shell. It is executed
        by the symlink org.bus1.administrator.
        - starts a tty login if /dev/tty1 exists
        - starts a serial console if console=<device> is given on the kernel
          command line

        org.bus1.init: The init process PID1.
        - resets the loader boot counter on successful bootup
        - starts org.bus1.activator

        org.bus1.rdinit: The init process PID1 in the initrd, symlinked from /init.
        - mounts /dev, /sys, /proc, /dev/pts, /sys/fs/bus1
        - starts org.bus1.acvitvator
                - starts org.bus1.devices
        - reads the kernel commandline:
                - disk=<UUID> locates the disk with the given GPT UUID
                        - the first EFI System Partition
                        - the first GPT partition with the type UUID of
                          e0243462-d2d0-4c3b-ad28-b365f2da3b4d
                - as an alternative it locates the devices:
                        - boot=/dev/<device>
                        - data=/dev/<device>
        - mounts the boot partition to /boot (r/o)
        - sets up verification of the system image named <release>.img
        - mounts the system image to /usr
                - the image is located relative to the
                  loader=<path to boot loader> variable
                - as an alternative is is located in the /boot
                  root directory
        - sets up decryption of the data partition
        - mounts the data partition to /var
        - executes org.bus1.init
